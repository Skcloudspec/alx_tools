My first readme
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!

Create these directories at the root of your project: html, css, js
Create these empty files:
home.html in the html directory
main.js in the js directory
style.css in the css directory
Create a file alx.js in the js directory with this one line inside: console.log("ALX")
Create a file school.js in the js with this one line inside: console.log("School")
Add all these new files to git
Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server
